After you have successful SSH access


To Gain Access to Fluidd you have to move some config files and make a few edits. Highly recommend backing up your config files first before doing this.

⁠Connect to the printer via SSH
⁠Copy the moonraker.conf over to the printer data config
cp /usr/share/moonraker/moonraker.conf /usr/data/printer_data/config/

In the /etc/init.d/S50nginx file, remove the comments from the lines:
mkdir -p /var/log/nginx /var/tmp/nginx

start-stop-daemon -S -x "$NGINX" -p "$PIDFILE"

In the /etc/init.d/S56moonraker_service file, remove the comment from the line:
start

Restart the printer (flipping the power switch worked for me)

You should now have access to fluidd by going to PrinterIP:4408
